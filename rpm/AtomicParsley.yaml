# these could be applied conditionally thusly:
#   < 4.1: need to lower CMake version
#   if CMake == 3.11, must give runtime destination
#   <= 3.1 must specify CXX standard because of older gcc
# BUT, conditional patching produces SRCRPMs that are not valid for all build environments,
# so we patch for all build for now

  - atomicparsley-cmake-3.11.patch
